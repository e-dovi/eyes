# eyes
The goal of this project is to simulate human eyes movement.

On the webpage the eyes follow the movement of the mouse.
This is caused by the **mousemove** event of JavaScript.

To set up the project locally please download the files and open the **index.html** file in a browser.

One improvement to this project could be adding a button to cause the eyes to stop following the mouse.
